# Vending Machine

JS Solution to the prompt:

You are tasked with creating a Vending Machine
that can lookup items sold and compute whether
or not a customer has provided enough coins to
purchase a selected item.

The vending machine has 2 important features.
Storing information about the products sold
by the **Vending Machine**, this includes
information about the current **inventory**
and the **price** .  And computing the total
amount of money provided by a customer given in
coin based increments (1 / 5 / 10 / 25 / 50).
How would you implement these
**Vending Machine** features?
