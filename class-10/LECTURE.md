# DSA: Stacks and Queues

## Review: Linked Lists

Linked List: An object that holds nodes, each node points to another node (node behind / next to it).
    * Has properties and methods that you define.
    * Methods let you think about the greater.
Node: Something that stores data, has 2 properties: value that reference the data, and next pointer that points to the next node in the list.
Head: The first node in a linked list.

## Overview

These are both types of linked lists.  Nodes do not change, the only thing that changing is where nodes are added and removed.

Stack: First in, last out (FiLo).  (nodes are added and removed in reverse order).
Queue: First in, First out (FiFo). (nodes are added and removed in the order they were added). 

## Terminology

* Top: the first node in a stack.
* Push: Adding a Node to the top of the stack (The only way to add)
* Pop: Removing a Node from the top of the stack (The only to remove)
* Front: Where nodes get removed from (The only place that nodes get added to)
* Rear / Back: Where nodes get added to (the only place...).
* Enqueue: Adding nodes and returning values on the rear of the queue.
* Dequeue Removing nodes and returning values from the front of the queue.
