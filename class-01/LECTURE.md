### Whiteboarding / Code Challenges

This course requires that you break abstract problems down to into specific details

* Lots of drawing
* A number of things we want you to practice

1. Understanding / coming with the details of a problem (asking questions about a particular domain)
2. Think about solutions algorithmically
   * What is a list of things you need to perform to solve.
3. Think in terms of computer operations
   * set variables
   * perfrom CRUD
   * run loops
   * render data to a webpage.
4. Write syntatically correct Code.

Every thursday's Code Challenge is meant to be done only on a "whiteboard"

## Writing Code within Node

Code running in node follows a couple of rules
   * Ever program / application has an export and potential imports
     * local files can be exported and run from other files on you local machine
     * export - `module.exports`
       * single object that is amde available to other "modules"
     * import = `require()`
