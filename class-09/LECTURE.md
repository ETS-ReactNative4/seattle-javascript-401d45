* Solidifying concepts over the last few weeks.
  * Liking the solidification.
* Andrew: allocating attention and time.
  * How much test writing is expected?
    * Only some, not a hige focus at the moment, prioritize you understanding.
* Joey: Go over Thunder Client.
  * HTTP clients in general (Postman, swagger).
* Thunder Client seems so much easier.
  * Copy paste request specifics and copy past the response.
  * Copy paste the response into Documentation.
