## Review

React Native / Expo cli

What is going well, what is not going so well?

* Kellen: Android Studio via USB did not work so well.
  * Perhaps a WSL issue.
  * Expo Go app does work.
    * Even the emulator tunnels through expo go.
  * (for WSL users ) Only install Android Studio on the subsystem that your code lives on.
* Daniel: can we look at styling.
  * We are going to do this today.
  * We'll be using NativeBase.
* Andrew: ios simulator xcode needs to be installed.
  * Where are devices are installed.

## React Native Feature Development

Let's build some features with React Native!

* Let's add Native Base and style on components
  * removing the components that react-native gives us and replacing them with Native Base.
  * Native Base will take care of the styling.
    * Props that handle many many styling problems.
* Stretch: Adding a URL image to a contact.


## Deployment

* Expo
* App Store / Play Store
